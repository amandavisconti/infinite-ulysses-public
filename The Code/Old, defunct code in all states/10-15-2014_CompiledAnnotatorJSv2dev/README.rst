Annotator is a JavaScript library for building annotation systems on the web. It
provides a set of tools to annotate text (and other content) in webpages, and to
save those annotations to a remote storage system. For a simple demonstration,
visit the `Annotator home page`_ or download a tagged release of Annotator from
`the releases page`_ and open ``demo.html``.

.. _the releases page: https://github.com/openannotation/annotator/releases

Annotator aims to provide a sensible default configuration which allows for
annotations of text in the browser, but it can also be extended in order to
provide:

-  persistence: storage components help you save your annotations to a remote
   server. One notable example is the |HTTPStorageComponent|_ which ships with
   Annotator and talks to the |AnnotatorStore|_.
-  rich metadata: the |DocumentPlugin|_ sniffs the page on which annotations are
   being made for document metadata (such as that provided by `Dublin Core
   tags`_ or the `Facebook Open Graph`_) that allows you to enrich the
   presentation of these annotations.
-  authentication and authorization: the |AuthComponent|_ allows you to restrict
   the creation of annotations to logged in users, while the
   |PermissionsComponent|_ allow you fine-grained control over who has
   permission to create and update annotations.
