annotation.install
On two instances—lines 48 and 56—change
'field_name' => 'name',
to
'field_name' => 'label',
Use of reserved word was causing a Drupal error: "FieldException: Attempt to create field name <em class="placeholder">name</em> which is reserved by entity type <em class="placeholder">taxonomy_term</em>. in field_create_field() (line 93 of /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/infiniteulysses.com/modules/field/field.crud.inc)." 
[I submitted a fix to this in the LacunaStories/Drupal-Master private repo here](https://github.com/LacunaStories/Drupal-Master/issues/5).

annotation.store.inc
On line 151, changed
$annotation->title = 'Annotation of ' . $node->title;
to
$annotation->title = 'link';
to fit display in annotation sidebar (since all displayed annotations are always on the same page, giving all the annotations on page 3 "Annotation of 3" as a title didn't make sense.

annotator.module
On line 18, changed
drupal_add_js(array('annotator' => array('element' => variable_get('annotator_element','.node'))), 'setting');
to
drupal_add_js(array('annotator' => array('element' => variable_get('annotator_element','.node-type-book .col-md-8'))), 'setting');
to fit the element digital editions using my code will want to annotate. 

Also changed this on line 12 of annotator.pages.inc

annotator.touch.css
Line 97: changed to cursor: pointer; 

UnsupportedAnnotatorPlugin.class.inc
Line 20: Updated message to "Annotation is not supported by this browser or you have Javascript disabled."
