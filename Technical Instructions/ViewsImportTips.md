# Views Import Tips
To import any of the views in this repo's The Code/Views folder via your Drupal dashboard, note that currently the "import view" option only appears if you are logged in as UID 1 (the site's first user account, with the user ID of 1). Even if you have the admin role, this won't appear on the Views list page unless you're logged in as UID 1.

This may not hold if you import a View using Drush (I haven't checked).
